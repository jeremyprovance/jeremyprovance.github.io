    "text": "My day job involves working with data at Adela as a clinical data manager. Adela’s mission is to develop technology to use simple blood draws to detect, diagnose, and manage cancer with an emphasis on early detection.\nI love all things data: wrangling, visualizing, and communicating it. I have worked with data sets big and small, public and proprietary, clinical and clinical-adjacent. I spend most of my time in RStudio using RMarkdown documents to do my work. I used Quarto in RStudio to make this website!\nBefore I was at Adela, I completed a master’s and doctorate in bioinformatics at the UMKC School of Medicine and completed postdoctoral work at Yale School of Medicine.\nOutside of work, I love to run and cycle and often tinker with my data to track and visualize performance and progress. I spend a lot of time hiking with my wife, Olivia, who is an oncology postdoc at Yale and my two dogs (who have both earned ceremonial dog-torates) Luna and Otto."
