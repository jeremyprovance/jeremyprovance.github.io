Hey, I'm Jeremy!

My day job involves working with data at [Adela](https://www.adelabio.com) as a clinical data manager. Adela's mission is to develop technology to use simple blood draws to detect, diagnose, and manage cancer with an emphasis on early detection.

I love all things data: wrangling, visualizing, and communicating it. I have worked with data sets big and small, public and proprietary, clinical and clinical-adjacent and have seen and overcome hundreds (if not more) of error messages in the process. I spend most of my time in RStudio using RMarkdown documents to do my work. I used Quarto in RStudio to make this website!

Before I was at Adela, I completed a master's and doctorate in bioinformatics at the UMKC School of Medicine and completed postdoctoral work at Yale School of Medicine.

Outside of work, I love to run and cycle and often tinker with my data to track and visualize performance and progress. I spend a lot of time hiking with my wife, [Olivia](https://oliviaprovance.github.io), who is an oncology postdoc at Yale and my two dogs (who have both earned ceremonial dog-torates) Luna and Otto.
