I'm a PhD student at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine studying bioinformatics. My research at the Saint Luke's Mid American Heart Institute is under the mentorship of Kim Smolderen, PhD. My aim is to use health data to better understand chronic disease, disease outcomes, and to empower patients to take an active role in creating better health.

I completed my undergraduate studies at William Jewell College studying biology and then spent time in the brewing industry before heading to graduate school. I received my master's in bioinformatics in 2017.
